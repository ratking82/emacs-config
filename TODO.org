Org projectile is setup to make a todo list for each repo for which
projectile has a record. If I was using a single file to record all
todos for projects then projectile creates a top level org heading
with the projects name title and links it to the location of the
project.

- When capturing a project todo while not in a project, make
  org-projectile ask for the name of a known projectile project.
